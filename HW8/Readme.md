**Learning objective:** To become concsiously aware of various website design and layout options with an eye toward good, mediocre, and bad design.

This assignment involves web browsing to 10 different popular websites that are listed below.   Your job is to evaluate each of them with regard to various aspects of web design.  Among questions you should ask yourself about each website are the following:

1. How is the general layout designed?  Is it based on colums, rows, or both?  If using columns, how many are there and does that enhance or reduce the website to deliver content?
2. Are there headers and footers included?  Are they helpful or just noise?  Are they fixed or do they move with the page?  Which is better for ease of navigation?
3. What sort of navigation is used?  Is it easy to use or do you have to hunt for the menu?
4. Consider each website and the use of color.  Are there common color schemes in use?  Is so, why might that be?  Are any clearly different that others? If so, why might that be?
5. Consider the use of typography.  What types of fonts are used?  Are any easier to read than others?  Is there consistency in the use of fonts on the website?
6. How is the content organized?  By topic? By date? Other?  What factors either help or hurt the website with regard to you actually conuming the content?
7. Any other observations that you find relevant that either adds value or reduces value for each website.
